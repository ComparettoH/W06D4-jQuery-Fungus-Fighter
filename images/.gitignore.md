To Dos:
[x] update _state_ variable(s)? (create?)
    [X] Freaky Fungus should lose hit points (HP)
        [Xish] Value can NOT be negative
        (set to zero if were to be negative)
    [X] Attack points (AP) will decrease as a result of this also
        [Xish] Value can NOT be negative (set to zero if were to be negative)
[X] create listener(s) for attack button(s)
[x] '_state_' may be held in one or more variable of my choice?

Render States changes to DOM:
[X] Update text above attack buttons (eg, "100 AP")
[X] Update text above fungus (eg, "100 HP")
[ ] if conditional for fungus running out of HP - replace 'walk' class with 'dead' for fungus element
[ ] if conditional for if run out of AP - replace 'walk' class with 'jump' class for fungus element
[ ] another conditional (or add to above?) when AP is 0 - 'disabled' all attack buttons
